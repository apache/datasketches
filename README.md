# DataSketches is now Apache DataSketches.

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences. Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods.

In 2019, after 8 years of development and 5 years as in Open Source, we began the important migration from a stand-alone GitHub site to being a member of the Apache Software Foundation community.  As of December, 2020, we became an official Top-Level Project within the ASF.

After years of development and community building, we now have parallel core library components for Java, C++, Python, and Go implementations of many of the same sketch algorithms:

- [datasketches-java](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-java)
- [datasketches-cpp](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp)
- [datasketches-python](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-python)
- [datasketches-go](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-go)

Please visit the main [DataSketches website](https://datasketches.apache.org) for more information.
